                My name is Emma Weber and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am
                currently in a 12 week full stack, full-time coding boot camp at
                the University of Denver. After a few years working for a start
                up in downtown Denver I've decided to change career paths and
                challenge myself to try something new! My interest in coding was
                sparked by a project I worked on with the Eng team in my most
                recent position--the colors, the layering, the ability to build
                something with creativity and skill, all caught my attention.

            So here we are, a look into my portfolio. A WIP to say the
            least,
            but I'm proud of what I've learned so far and am excited to keep
            progressing!
